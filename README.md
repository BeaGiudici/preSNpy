# preSNpy
`Python` package to play with pre-supernova progenitor stars.

## Requirements

This package is built entirely in `Python` and it requires a version of [Python3](https://www.python.org/) to be used in all its power.
Besides, the package is based on the use of different `Python` libraries:
 - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
 - [h5Py](https://www.h5py.org/)
 - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

Be careful to have them installed on your machine before starting to use `preSNpy`.
